# Blockchain-Based Voting System

This repository contains a blockchain-based voting system developed as a college project. The goal of the project is to utilize blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent voting process.

## Key Features

- **Security**: By leveraging blockchain, the system ensures that votes are tamper-proof and securely recorded.
- **Transparency**: All votes are publicly verifiable on the blockchain, ensuring transparency in the voting process.
- **Decentralization**: The voting system is decentralized, eliminating the need for a central authority.

## Components

The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Backend**: Implements the server-side logic using Django, along with the smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Frontend**: A React-based web application that provides an interface for users to interact with the voting system.
3. **Smart Contracts**: Developed using Truffle, these contracts handle the voting logic and ensure the integrity of the voting process.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the instructions in the [README.md](README.md) file to set up and run the application.

## How to Use

Once the application is running, you can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5173`. The user interface will guide you through the voting process.
